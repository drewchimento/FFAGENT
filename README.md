# FFAGENT
I want to build an app/ai agent or whatever it is that I need to build to help fantasy footballers in their upcoming fantasy football draft. I want to model "Cluely". But also, try and figure out how to make it mobile friendly. I think this could be a million dollar idea. I need you help making that happen. In essence, I want this-lets call it "FFAgent", to be your right hand man in while you're drafting live on either ESPN, Yahoo, etc. The user will be able to select which statistics are important to them (such as how many yards did they have last year, and just basically all the key items that may be useful to know before drafting a player), and the that AI Agent that is seeing everything that is taken place in the draft will provide live time suggestions to the user. Those live time suggestions will be tailored by the user in the settings where they can adjust the type of stats they want to see while in the live draft.
