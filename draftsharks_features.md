# DraftSharks - Key Features

DraftSharks offers a comprehensive suite of fantasy football tools, with a strong emphasis on real-time draft assistance and dynamic player valuation. Key features include:

## Live Draft Sync & Dynamic Player Values:
- **Draft War Room with LIVE Draft Sync:** This is a centerpiece feature that live-syncs to all leagues and monitors 17 crucial in-draft value indicators in real-time. It automatically updates the draft board as players are selected.
- **Dynamic Player Values:** Adjusts rankings to fit the user's specific draft, considering factors like league scoring, positional value, 3D projections, real-time team needs, opponent team needs, changing position scarcity, injury risk, breakout likelihood, correlated ADP, bye week conflicts, flex options, bench depth, Trust Factor, personalized projection adjustments, positional tier, and strength of schedule.

## Mock Draft & Preparation:
- **Mock Draft Trainer:** Helps users prepare by simulating drafts with league settings.

## Rankings & Projections:
- **Format-Specific Rankings:** Provides re-draft, dynasty, rookie, auction, and best ball rankings.
- **Award-Winning Projections:** Rankings are powered by constantly tweaked projections tailored to league settings.
- **ADP Market Index:** Provides real-time, customizable ADP data across formats and platforms.

## Keeper League Assistance:
- **Keeper Calculator:** Helps answer keeper questions by considering long-term vs. short-term value and draft costs.
- **Keeper Score Calculation:** Identifies the best players to keep based on current and future value.

## Other Notable Features:
- **Comprehensive ADP Tool:** Continuously updates to reflect current trends and injuries, and compares ADP with rankings to identify sleepers and busts.

## Pain Points/Limitations (Inferred):
- **Subscription-Based:** While not explicitly stated as a pain point, the comprehensive nature and advanced features suggest a subscription model, which might be a barrier for some users.
- **Complexity:** The sheer number of indicators and dynamic adjustments, while powerful, could potentially be overwhelming for novice users.
- **Integration:** Similar to FantasyPros, it appears to be a separate tool that runs alongside the draft platform, rather than being fully integrated within it.
